# Day 1 Study Notes: Software Testing Foundations

## Session Information
- **Date**: February 5, 2026  
- **Study Block**: 2 hours
- **Focus Areas**: Testing Fundamentals, SDLC, Test Design

## Core Concepts Learned

### 1. What is Software Testing?
**Definition**: The process of evaluating a software product to identify defects, ensure quality, and verify requirements.

**Key Insight**: Testing is not just finding bugs, but a process to build quality throughout the development lifecycle.

### 2. Quality Assurance vs. Quality Control
| Aspect | Quality Assurance (QA) | Quality Control (QC) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Focus** | Proactive prevention of defects | Reactive identification of defects |
| **Timing** | Process-oriented (throughout SDLC) | Product-oriented (testing phase) |
| **Goal** | Prevent defects | Identify defects in finished product |

### 3. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Phases
Your notes cover the 7 SDLC phases with testing activities:

| SDLC Phase | Testing Activities in Each Phase |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| **1. Planning** | Test strategy, resource planning |
| **2. Requirements Analysis** | Requirement reviews, test plan creation |
| **3. Design** | Test case design, test data preparation |
| **4. Implementation** | Unit testing, integration testing |
| **5. Testing** | System testing, acceptance testing |
| **6. Deployment** | User acceptance testing (UAT) |
| **7. Maintenance** | Regression testing, production support |

### 4. Test Levels and Types
```yaml
Testing Levels:
- Unit Testing: Developer-level, tests individual components
- Integration Testing: Component interaction
- System Testing: Whole system validation  
- Acceptance Testing: User acceptance (UAT)

Testing Types:
- Functional: "Does it work?"
- Non-Functional: Performance, security, usability
- Manual vs. Automated Testing
